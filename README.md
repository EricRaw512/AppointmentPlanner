git clone https://github.com/EricRaw512/AppointmentPlanner.git
```

**2. Create MySQL database**

```bash

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The app will start running at <http://localhost:8080>

**5. Close the app and run the sql**

**6. Login to admin account**

+ username: `admin`

## Account types 

`admin` -  is created at database initialization. Admin can add new providers,  services and assign services to providers. Admin can see list of all: appointments, providers, customers.

`provider` - can by created by admin only. Provider can set his own working plan, add breaks to that working plan and change his available services. Provider sees only his own appointments.

`customer ` - registration page is public and can be created by everyone. Customer can only book new appointments and manage them.

## Booking process

To book a new appointment customer needs to click `New Appointment` button on all appointments page and then:

1. Choose desired work from available works list
2. Choose provider for selected work
3. Choose on of available date which is presented to him
4. Click book on confirmation page

Available hours are calculatated with getAvailableHours function from AppointmentService:

`List<TimePeroid> getAvailableHours(int providerId, int workId, int customerId, LocalDate date)`

This function works as follow:

1. gets selected provider working plan
2. gets working hours from working plan for selected day 
3. excludes all breaks from working hours
4. excludes all providers booked appointments for that day
5. excludes all customers booked appointments for that day
6. gets selected work duration and calculate available time peroids 
7. returns available hours

## Appointments lifecycle

**1. Every appointment has it's own status. Below you can find description for every possible status:**

| Status                | Set by   | When                                           | Condition                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scheudled`           | system   | New appointment is created                     | -                                                            |
| `finished`            | system   | Current date is after appointment end time     | current appointment status is `scheduled` and current date is after appointment end time |
| `confirmed`           | system   | Current date is 24h after appointment end time | current appointment status is `finished` and current date is more than 24h after appointment end time |
| `canceled`            | customer | Customer clicks cancel button                  | current appointment status is `scheduled` and current date is not less than 24h before appointment start time and user total canceled appointments number for current month is not greater than 1 |
| `rejection requested` | customer | Customer clicks reject button                  | current appointment status is `finished` and current date is not more than 24h after appointment end time |
| `rejected`            | provider | Provider clicks accept rejection button        | current appointment status is `rejection requested`          |

**2. Normal appointment lifecycle is:**

1. scheduled - after user creates new appointment
2. finished - after system time is after appointment end time
3. confirmed - after system time is more than 24h after appointment end time and user didn't request rejection

**3. Appointment rejection**

In case the appointment didn't take place, an alternative method is provided for the customer to reject that the appointment occurred. This can be done within the application interface.

- The rejection option is available for 24 hours after the scheduled end time of the appointment.
- If the customer doesn't indicate the rejection within this time frame, the appointment status will automatically change to confirmed after 24 hours. Subsequently, it will be invoiced on the 1st day of the next month.
- If the customer chooses to reject the appointment within the given period, the system will automatically notify the provider within the application interface. The provider can then review and accept or reject the customer's rejection request.
- If the provider accepts the rejection, the appointment status will be changed to rejection accepted, and the appointment will not be invoiced.

**4. Apppointment cancellation**

Every appointment can be canceled by customer if allowed or provider. Customer is allowed to cancel 2 appointment in a month no less than 24h before appointment start date. Provider is allowed to cancel his appointments without any limit as long as the appointment status is `scheduled`.
